  <h2>Defining Industrial Design</h2>
 <p>Industrial design, the profession of designing products ranging from ornamental to usable 
 products. Its important for designers to see the world from an outside perspective. This gives insight
 to see how things work, and to observe the different habits and perspectives people have. Through these observations designers can make huge innovative changes for a growing society. Observation and research can lead to purposeful, innovative, and long lasting products.

 <h2>Defining My Work</h2>
  <p>Functionality is the core principle behind my creations. Functionality can be defined in two ways: having a special purpose and purposeful design. I try to gear my designs to represent these definitions. I value quality, longevity, innovation and sustainable. Finding new ways to create and design objects is a passion of mine. Its an industrial designers job to imporove theway humans live. </p>

         <h1>Chop Block</h1>
         <p>The Chop Block is meant to innovate on the users cooking experience. I combined the design of a dough cutter with the function of a chefs knife to create a product thats perfect for cutting and carrying food from the blade to your plate or stove. The ergonomic shape of the handle is fit to the palm and fingers. The blade shape lets the user cut in a repeated motion with ease.</p>

            <h1>Bike Helmet</h1>
            <p>I designed this foldable bike helmet for a few reasons. A small amount of cycylisyts actually wear helmets, helmets are too chunky to bring around and cyclists need head protecting in their compotion against other vehicles. I chose to value a helmet that would be worn more rather then being supper protective in this design. </p></div>
