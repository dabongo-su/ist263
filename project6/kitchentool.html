    <h2>Idea</h2>
    <p>After interviewing a multiple people who work with kitchen tools regularly. I found that knifes and
        cutting boards were the top kitchen stables. The Chop Block is meant to innovate on the two most used kitchen utensils; A cutting board and knife. A knifes shape plays a huge role in the kitchen. A chefs knifes design is simple, with a long and broad blade that comes to a point. This shape is ideal for mincing herbs and vegtables with speed and accuracy. The shape of the chop cutters also takes inspiration from the shape of a dough cutter. My design is meant to chop herbs, vegatables, fruit and meat on a rocking motion with room to scoop the food on the knife to bring to cookware on the stove or onto your plate. I wanted to create a functional 
        piece that cater towards making cooking easier. Inside the cutting board are magnets that hold the 
        handles in place. 
        </p>
    <h2>Materials</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Hickery Wood</li>
    <li>2 pieces of stainless steel</li>
    <li>2 stripes of steel</li>
    <li>6 Neodymium magnets</li>
    <li>4 nail</li>
    <li>Epoxy</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p> I started the process off by cutting and shaping the hickery into two 11" by 21" with a width of 2" pieces. The boards into stripes for aesthetic purposes. Once the two pieces were glued back together, A router was used to cut four divets out of the ends of each board. Inside each divets there are 3 magnets to hinge to the chop cutters. The two hickery boards were then glued together. After the cutting board was completed I started on the chop cutters. I grinded and shaped the two pieces of stainless steel. the I then used epoxy to glue the stipes of steel for magnetivity. Once the handles were shaped the metal was epoxied in, along with the nails for extra security. For the final steps, the wood was sanded to retail quality. Lastly I finished off the wood with mineral oil to fill grain to prevent warping and cracking. Wax was used for the steel cutters to prevent rust and wear.</p>
