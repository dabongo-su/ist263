        My name is Delaney Bongo. I am currently a junior studying Industrial and Interaction Design. Product design intrigues me for many reasons, I enjoy problem solving and examining every aspect of the world to create a more innovated future. I have created and designed several projects from research to a working prototype. Some things I have made are a folding helmet, cutting board with chop cutters and more. Outside of Industrial design I also enjoy metalsmithing and jewelry making. Most of my hobbies include creating objects for personal enjoyment or use. Other interests of mine include watching scary movies/tv series, dogs, hiking and enjoying nature.
