    <h2>Hickery Cutting Board With Chop Cutters</h2>
    <hr>
    <div class="imgcenter"> <img name="slide" width="600" height="600" alt="Cutting board slide show"></div>
    <section><h2>Idea</h2>
        <p>After interviewing multiple people who work with kitchen tools regularly, I found that knives and
            cutting boards were the top kitchen staples. The Chop Block is meant to innovate on the two most used kitchen utensils: a cutting board and knife. A knife's shape plays a huge role in the kitchen. A chef's knife's design is simple, with a long and broad blade that comes to a point. This shape is ideal for mincing herbs and vegetables with speed and accuracy. The shape of the chop cutters also takes inspiration from the shape of a dough cutter. My design is meant to chop herbs, vegetables, fruit, and meat in a rocking motion. The blade has room to scoop the food onto the knife to transfer to cookware on the stove or onto your plate. I wanted to create a functional
            piece geared toward making cooking easierInside the cutting board are magnets that hold the
            handles in place.

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p> I started the process off by cutting and shaping the hickory into two 11" by 21" pieces. The boards are divided into stripes for aesthetic purposes. Once the two pieces were glued back together, a router was used to cut four sections out of the ends of each board. Inside each divet, there are three magnets to attach the chop cutters. The two hickory boards were then glued together. After the cutting board was completed, I started on the chop cutters. I grinded and shaped the two pieces of stainless steel. I then used epoxy to glue the steel strips together for magnetism. Once the handles were shaped, the metal was epoxied in, along with the nails for extra security. For the final steps, the wood was sanded to retail quality. Lastly, I finished off the wood with mineral oil to fill the grain and prevent warping and cracking. Wax was used for the steel cutters to prevent rust and wear.</p>
