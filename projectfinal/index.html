      <h2>Defining Industrial Design</h2>
     <p>Industrial design is the profession of creating products that range from ornamental to functional. It's important for designers to see the world from an outside perspective. This provides insight into how things work and allows one to observe different people's habits and perspectives. Through these observations, designers can make huge innovative changes for a growing society. Observation and research can lead to purposeful, innovative, and long lasting products.

     <h2>Defining My Work</h2>
      <p>Functionality is the core principle behind my creations. Functionality can be defined in two ways: having a special purpose and purposeful design. I try to gear my designs to represent these definitions. I value quality, longevity, innovation, and sustainability. Finding new ways to create and design objects is a passion of mine. It's an industrial designer's job to improve the way humans live. </p>

            <h1>Chop Block</h1>
            <p>The Chop Block is intended to improve the user's cooking experience. I combined the design of a dough cutter with the function of a chefs' knife to create a product thats perfect for cutting and carrying food from the blade to your plate or stove. The ergonomic shape of the handle fits the palm and fingers. The blade shape lets the user cut in a repeated motion with ease.</p>

               <h1>Bike Helmet</h1>
               <p>I designed this foldable bike helmet for a few reasons. A small percentage of cyclists actually wear helmets, helmets are too chunky to bring around, and cyclists need head protection in their proximity to other vehicles. I chose to value a helmet that would be worn more than being super protective in this design. </p>
