    <h1>Compactable Bike Helmet</h1>

        <h2>Idea</h2>
     <p>My goal for this project was to create a helmet that is protective and fits my head. I decided to
        design my helmet for the everyday cyclist. People ride bikes as a means of everyday transportation.
        Given that biking is so common and frequent, I decided to design and prototype a more compact bicycle.
        helmet. My folding helmet will make its transportation easier. It's very common for people to not
        wear a helmet because of its bulkiness and burden. According to safety.fhwa.dot.gov, only 18%
        of bicyclists wear bike helmets. In this case, convenience and protection come at a cost. I believe if bike
        helmets were easier to store, people would wear them much more often. My hope is to increase the
        percentage of people wearing bike helmets while also still protecting them from any accidents.

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p> My front and side profile pictures were taken and transformed in Photoshop to size the images accurately. Once the images were printed, I made a foamcore stand that was used to guide the shape of the helmet to fit my head. I then taped my head to get the exact shape. Once the tape formation was cut into the shapes I needed, I used its measurements to translate them into the foam pieces. Once the foam was cut into the correct shapes, I used a heat gun to bend each piece. With each piece in the correct shape, I lined the pieces with fiber glass paper and aqua resin in multiple layers. When the pieces were hardened, I sanded them until it was completely smooth. Then i used two nails and washers to combine the pieces where they could move. Finally, the helmet was spray painted, and the straps were attached. </p></div>
